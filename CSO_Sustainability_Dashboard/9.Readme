Key metrics used by the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) to assess and monitor sustainability performance vary depending on the organization's industry, goals, and priorities. Here are some common key metrics used by CSOs to measure sustainability:

Carbon footprint: Measure the total greenhouse gas emissions (CO2e) generated by the organization's operations, including direct emissions (Scope 1) and indirect emissions from purchased electricity, heat, and steam (Scope 2), and indirect emissions from the supply chain and other sources (Scope 3).

Energy consumption: Track the total energy consumption across different sources, including electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, and renewable energy sources, to identify opportunities for energy efficiency improvements and emissions reductions.

Water usage: Measure the total water consumption by the organization's operations, including withdrawals from freshwater sources and discharges to wastewater treatment facilities, to identify opportunities for water conservation and sustainable water management.

Waste generation and diversion: Track the total amount of waste generated by the organization's operations, including solid waste, hazardous waste, and recyclable materials, and monitor waste diversion rates to landfill, recycling, and composting facilities.

Sustainable sourcing: Monitor the percentage of sustainable and responsibly sourced materials, products, and services used in the organization's operations, including raw materials, ingredients, and packaging, to promote ethical sourcing practices and reduce environmental impacts.

Renewable energy usage: Measure the percentage of renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, hydroelectric, and geothermal energy, used to power the organization's operations, buildings, and facilities, to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lower carbon emissions.

Eco-efficiency: Calculate eco-efficiency metrics, such as greenhouse gas emissions per unit of production, energy consumption per unit of output, and water usage per unit of revenue, to assess resource efficiency and environmental performance relative to business activities.

Employee engagement: Assess employee engagement and participation in sustainability initiatives, such as volunteer programs, green teams, and training sessions, to foster a culture of sustainability and corporate social responsibility (CSR) within the organization.

Community impact: Measure the social and economic impact of the organization's operations on local communities, including job creation, economic development, charitable contributions, and community partnerships, to promote positive social outcomes and stakeholder engagement.

Sustainability reporting: Evaluate the quality, comprehensiveness, and transparency of sustainability reporting practices, including adherence to international standards (e.g., GRI, SASB, TCFD) and alignment with stakeholder expectations, to communicate sustainability performance effectively to internal and external stakeholders.

These key metrics provide CSOs with valuable insights into the organization's sustainability performance, progress towards sustainability goals, and areas for improvement, enabling data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement of sustainability initiatives.
